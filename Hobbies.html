        <li><p>
            Playing music <br/>
            I have played the piano since I was six years old. At the age of
            twelve I also took up the guitar. Later on I gave the drums a try.
            I still have a very big interest in everything involving music.

            Running <br/>
            I like to set big goals and keeping to a training schedule. In the past
            I ran some half marathons. Maybe the full marathon will happen in the future.
        </p></li>

            Cycling <br/>
            Even though I love running, when the wheather is getting too hot, I prefer
            to cycle. I prefer road cycling, but you can also tag me along on a mountain
            bike ride.
        </p></li>

            Reading <br/>
            Although I do not always find the time to read full books, I am always starting
            new ones. I like a mix of fiction and non-fiction books.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Team sports <br/>
            The previous sports I mentioned were individual, but I do like having some type
            of competition and working together with a team. That is why I like any sport
            going from football to basketball to...
